# Usage
Use /flyspeed <speed> [player] to set a player's fly speed. The default speed is 0.05 (vanilla default), which can be changed in the config. Fly speeds over 0.8 can result in position desync in some cases.

# Config
`self-perm` - Permission to change your own fly speed. Default: customflyspeed.command.self  
`other-perm` - Permission to change other players fly speed. Default: customflyspeed.command.others  
`default-fly-speed` - Default fly speed. Default: 0.05
